# Woofy-Definitions
Definitions for the Webcomic Downloader Woofy
Woofy can be downloaded here: https://github.com/vladiliescu/woofy

some were downloaded (or came with the app) but most of these definitions were created by me.
Definitions will be added/updated when I do so for my own usage. 

NOTE: Some definitions fail with a "WARNING: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel." error. This is an issue with Woofy and needs to be addressed before these definitions will work.
